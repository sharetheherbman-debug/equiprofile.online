## Deployment Overview

EquiProfile is deployed on a single VPS with a traditional LAMP-style stack optimized for simplicity and reliability.

### Architecture

```
Internet
    ↓
Nginx (Port 80/443)
    ↓
Node.js/Express (Port 3000)
    ↓
MySQL Database (Port 3306)
    ↓
AWS S3 (Document Storage)
```

### Deployment Components

**Nginx Reverse Proxy:**
- Receives all HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Terminates SSL/TLS connections
- Forwards requests to Node.js application
- Serves static assets with caching
- Enforces request size limits (50MB for document uploads)
- Rate limiting at proxy level

**Node.js Application:**
- Express server running on port 3000
- PM2 process manager for supervision
- Cluster mode for multi-core usage
- Automatic restart on failure
- Log rotation and management

**MySQL Database:**
- Dedicated database server on same VPS
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Automated daily backups
- Query optimization and indexing

**Environment Variables:**
- Stored in `.env` file on server
- Loaded at application startup
- Contains sensitive credentials
- Different values per environment
- Never exposed to client

**Critical Environment Variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - MySQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Session token signing key
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe API key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook verification
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - S3 credentials
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - AI service access

### Webhook Handling

**Stripe Webhooks:**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/webhooks/stripe`
- Raw body parsing required for signature verification
- Webhook secret validates authenticity
- Idempotency prevents duplicate processing
- Event types handled:
  - `checkout.session.completed` - New subscription
  - `customer.subscription.updated` - Subscription change
  - `customer.subscription.deleted` - Cancellation
  - `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Successful payment
  - `invoice.payment_failed` - Payment failure

**Webhook Security:**
1. Receive POST request from Stripe
2. Extract signature from headers
3. Verify signature using webhook secret
4. Check idempotency (event already processed?)
5. Process event and update database
6. Return 200 OK to acknowledge receipt

### Deployment Process

**Initial Deployment:**
1. Provision VPS and configure firewall
2. Install Node.js, MySQL, Nginx
3. Clone repository to `/var/www/equiprofile`
4. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
5. Create `.env` file with production values
6. Run database migrations: `pnpm db:push`
7. Build application: `pnpm build`
8. Configure Nginx virtual host
9. Obtain SSL certificate via Certbot
10. Start application with PM2
11. Configure automated backups
12. Set up Stripe webhook endpoint

**Updates and Maintenance:**
1. Pull latest code: `git pull origin main`
2. Install new dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Run migrations if needed: `pnpm db:push`
4. Build application: `pnpm build`
5. Restart application: `pm2 restart equiprofile`
6. Verify health check passes

**Zero-Downtime Updates:**
1. PM2 cluster mode runs multiple instances
2. New code deployed to cluster
3. Instances restarted one at a time
4. Old instances serve traffic during restart
5. New instances take over when ready

### Post-Deployment Setup

**1. Create First Admin User:**
```bash
# Connect to MySQL
mysql -u root -p

# Update user role to admin
USE equiprofile;
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
exit;
```

**2. Test Admin Unlock:**
- Login to the application
- Navigate to `/ai-chat`
- Type "show admin"
- Enter password (default: `ashmor12@`)
- Verify admin panel access at `/admin`

**3. Change Admin Password:**
```bash
# Edit .env file
nano /var/www/equiprofile/.env

# Update this line:
ADMIN_UNLOCK_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# Restart application
pm2 restart equiprofile
```

**4. Configure Backups:**
```bash
# Make backup script executable
chmod +x /var/www/equiprofile/scripts/backup.sh

# Add to crontab for daily backups at 2 AM
crontab -e
# Add: 0 2 * * * /var/www/equiprofile/scripts/backup.sh
```

**5. Verify System Health:**
- Check application logs: `pm2 logs equiprofile`
- Test health endpoint: `curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health`
- Verify database connectivity
- Test S3 file uploads
- Confirm Stripe webhook delivery

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** - JavaScript runtime
- **pnpm 10+** - Package manager
- **MySQL 8.0+** - Database server
- **Git** - Version control

### Local Setup

**1. Clone Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/equiprofile.git
cd equiprofile
```

**2. Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pnpm install
```

This installs both server and client dependencies in a single command.

**3. Configure Environment:**

Create `.env` file in project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/equiprofile_dev
JWT_SECRET=dev_secret_change_in_production
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

# Stripe (use test keys)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_YEARLY_PRICE_ID=price_test_xxxxx

# Optional for full functionality
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxx
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxx
AWS_S3_BUCKET=equiprofile-dev
```

Create `client/.env`:

```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
VITE_ENV=development
```

**4. Setup Database:**

Create development database:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE equiprofile_dev;
```

Run migrations:

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

### Development Commands

**Start Development Server:**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts:
- Vite development server with hot reload
- Express API server with auto-restart
- Available at `http://localhost:3000`

**Type Checking:**

```bash
pnpm check
```

Runs TypeScript compiler without emitting files. Checks for type errors across entire codebase.

**Run Tests:**

```bash
pnpm test
```

Executes Vitest test suite with all unit tests.

**Format Code:**

```bash
pnpm format
```

Runs Prettier to format all files according to project standards.

**Build for Production:**

```bash
pnpm build
```

Creates optimized production build:
- Client: `dist/` directory with optimized assets
- Server: `dist/` directory with compiled server code

**Start Production Build:**

```bash
pnpm start
```

Runs production build locally. Requires successful `pnpm build` first.

### Database Migrations

**Generate Migration:**

After modifying `drizzle/schema.ts`:

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

This:
1. Generates migration SQL files
2. Applies migrations to database
3. Updates schema types

**Migration Files:**

Located in `drizzle/` directory:
- `schema.ts` - Source of truth for schema
- `relations.ts` - Foreign key relationships
- `0000_*.sql` - Generated migration files

### Working with tRPC

**Adding a New Endpoint:**

1. Define procedure in `server/routers.ts`:

```typescript
myNewEndpoint: protectedProcedure
  .input(z.object({ id: z.number() }))
  .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    return db.getMyData(input.id);
  })
```

2. TypeScript automatically generates client types
3. Use in client:

```typescript
const { data } = trpc.myNewEndpoint.useQuery({ id: 1 });
```

**Type Safety:**
- Server types flow to client automatically
- Input validation via Zod schemas
- Compile-time errors for mismatched types
- IntelliSense support in IDE

### Testing Workflow

**Unit Tests:**

Create test file alongside source:
- `server/myFeature.test.ts` for server code
- `client/src/myComponent.test.tsx` for components

Run specific test file:

```bash
pnpm test myFeature.test.ts
```

**Manual Testing:**

1. Start development server
2. Use browser DevTools
3. Check Network tab for API calls
4. Verify React DevTools components
5. Test responsive design

### Debugging

**Server Debugging:**
- Console logs appear in terminal
- Request logging shows all API calls
- PM2 logs in production: `pm2 logs equiprofile`

**Client Debugging:**
- Browser DevTools Console
- React DevTools for component inspection
- Network tab for API request/response

**Database Debugging:**

Query database directly:

```bash
mysql -u root -p equiprofile_dev
SELECT * FROM horses;
```
