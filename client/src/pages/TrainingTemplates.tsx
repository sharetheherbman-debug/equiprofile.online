 * This file manages HORSE TRAINING PLAN templates only:
 *   - Pre-designed exercise/workout schedules for horses
 *   - Users apply these templates to their horses' training logs
 *   - Route: /training-templates (protected, authenticated users)
 *
 * This is NOT the admin email campaign system. For email campaigns:
 *   client/src/pages/AdminCampaigns.tsx  (admin-only, inside Admin panel)
 *   server/_core/emailTemplates.ts       (HTML email template definitions)

 * The PREDESIGNED_TEMPLATES constant below is also mirrored (read-only)
